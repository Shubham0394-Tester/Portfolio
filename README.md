# About me
üëã **Hi, I'm Shubham Shirke**
I'm a Software Test Engineer with hands-on experience in testing desktop, mobile, and web applications. **Since 2021,** I‚Äôve specialized in manual testing, including functional, UI, regression, retesting, smoke, sanity, and cross-browser testing, always with a strong focus on quality and user experience.**I have a strong understanding of STLC, SDLC, and a passion for delivering high-quality user experiences.**

I enjoy making sure every product I test works smoothly, consistently, and exactly as intended. Recently, **I‚Äôve expanded into test automation, working with tools like Selenium, Java, TestNG, and Cucumber (BDD) to enhance the speed and efficiency of testing.**

Although my academic background is non-IT, it helped me develop strong discipline and attention to detail‚Äîqualities that have been essential in my QA work.

# Example of my work
